散开电流: **good title** and **good content**. The difference is in **what** it generates the HTML for a page.
```javascript
import x from './sldkf';
const y = 34;
function xd() {
  console.log('sdkf');
}
```
- **good title** is so `good` to do something I don't know **build time**. The very good HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **good content** is the xxxx-yyyy method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, react and vue lets you **choose** which framework form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" nnnnn ddd iiiii ooooo Generation for most pages and using sssss-ssss Rendering for others.
