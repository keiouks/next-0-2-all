this 555 using **some thing good** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- test test
- paper posts
- E-EEE product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "where am I, who am I  **bra bra** good try test?" If there are something good , then you should choose Static page.

good good thing, render and render is **awsome** and the good idea for you to pre-render a page for request. Maybe your my time effection kkkk, www iiiii wwwww ooooo sssss nnnnn hhhhhh.

In that case, you can use **sssss-sssss ssssss**. It will be slower, but the ssss-sssss page will always be ssss-ssss-ssssss. Or you can skip ssssss-sssssss and use ssssss-ssssss ssssss to sssssss ssssss.
